  <p> The Search Engine alogirthm relies on the use of a hashmap, where files are arbitrarily read in from a directory of documents, with each bucket in the hashmap 
    containing a linkedlist of words, and each word contains a linkedlist of assocaited documents. The program accepts a string from user input and searches for each word, seperated by a space, to determine
    the frequency each word falls in a document. It ranks the presence in each document and presents the documents in order of most to least frequent. 
    This project is from an assignment in a Computer Architecture course. </p>

    <p>The goal of this project is to analyze the data given: temperature, pressure, humidity, and an indicator of whether or not it rained at different times of the day. To be able to understand the data, it is broken into three histograms and the data stored in buckets, depending on the reading. The packets of readings are sent one per second, with each packet being an hour's worth of data. This process is split in two. This splitting occurs with forking and pipes. The two pipes, signal and data, communicate by sending user input to the arduino with signal and reading data with the data pipe. This is done through the child process. The parent process does the other half, reading signals from the arduino and sending data through the data pipe. 
      Therefore, the child process works primarily with the front end and user input, while the parent process works with the back end and arduino process.
      This project is from an assignment in a Systems Programming course.</p>

  <p>This is integration project takes a current student at GWU through the processes of being a student. Once admitted, 
    students are able to use this platform throughout their years at GWU. Each semester, students are able to register for courses of their choice. 
    Their options can vary in professor and time scheduling, allowing them to choose the optimal schedule to graduate on time. To prepare for graduation, 
    the students must submit a Form 1, detailing the courses they plan to take to fulfill their program's (Masters or PhD) requirements. 
    This Form automatically goes through an audit, ensuring their plan allows them to graduate. When the time comes, students will be able to apply for graduation. 
    Once approved, they become alumunus and can now only have access to their transcripts from when they were students at the university. </p>

    <p>Other users included on this platform are faculty members (who also act as advisors), the graduate secretary, 
    and the system administrator. Faculty members are also instructors for courses. They are able to access all of the courses 
    they teach in a given semester, as well as the transcripts of the students in their courses. Additionally, faculty can add final grades for their 
    students. As advisors, faculty members have the ability to review the Form 1 submissions of their advisees to ensure they're on the right path to 
    graduation. In the special case of PhD students, advisors are able to approve the thesis of their PhD advisees. The graduate secretary is able to 
    override any course grade entries a faculty may have added. They are also responsible for assigning advisors to students, and approving a student to 
    graduate. The system administrator has access to all of the capabilities of the faculty and graduate secretary.</p>
