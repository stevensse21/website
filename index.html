      <p>Hi everyone! I am a third year Computer Science major and Business Administration minor at The George Washington University.
    Since my senior year of high school, I have been in love with programming and Computer Science. I believe with the 
    vast different routes one can take in Computer Science, an education in the field can be beneficial in any way.</p>
    <p>During my senior year of high school, I began to teach myself basic Java programming because of my curiousity. The AP Computer Science
      teacher heard of my endeavors and reached out, suggesting I take the AP exam at the end of the season, even though I was not 
      enrolled in the class. I accepted the offer and began teaching myself the course in my free time. With each lesson, I fell
      more in love with the field. By the end of the school year, I realized this was my passion, began the process of switching majors
      for the start of college, and also scored extremely well on the AP exam. Since then, I have been extremely eager to learn and 
      practice my programming/computer science skills and look forward to expanding my knowledge both in and out of classes.</p>
  <p> My relevant coursework includes Website Software Development, Algorithms & Data Structures, Discrete Structures, Software Engineering, 
    Computer Architecture, Ethics in Computing, Foundations of Computing, and Databases. I am currently enrolled in Operating Systems,
    Algorithms, and Software Design for Handheld Devices.</p>
  <p>I am currently interested in pursuing software engineering but would like to further my education in the future with Articial
    Intelligence and Machine Learning. Feel free to reach out through any of the links below or explore the site to get to know
    me better!</p>
